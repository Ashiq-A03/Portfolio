--secondary-color: #764ba2;
--accent-color: #ffd89b;
```

```html
<section id="new-section" class="new-section">
    <div class="container">
        <h2 class="section-title">New Section Title</h2>
        <!-- Your content here -->
    </div>
</section>
```

### Modifying Animations
Animation speeds and effects can be adjusted in the CSS:

```css
/* Animation duration */
transition: all 0.3s ease;

/* Animation delay */
animation-delay: 0.2s;
```
